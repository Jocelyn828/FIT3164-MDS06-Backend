        "Abstract": "Background: Recommendations against prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in\n2012 have increased advanced-stage diagnosis and prostate cancer–specific mortality\nrates.\nObjective: To present the position of the European Association of Urology (EAU) in\n2021 and provide recommendations for the use of PSA testing as part of a risk-adapted\nstrategy for the early detection of prostate cancer.\nEvidence acquisition: The authors combined their review of relevant literature, including the EAU prostate cancer guidelines 2021 update, with their own knowledge to\nprovide an expert opinion, representing the EAU’s position in 2021.\nEvidence synthesis: The EAU has developed a risk-adapted early prostate cancer detection strategy for well-informed men based on PSA testing, risk calculators, and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, which can differentiate significant from\ninsignificant prostate cancer. This approach largely avoids the overdiagnosis/overtreatment of men unlikely to experience disease-related symptoms during their lifetime and\nfacilitates an early diagnosis of men with significant cancer to receive active treatment. It\nalso reduces advanced-stage diagnosis, thereby potentially reducing prostate cancer–\nspecific mortality and improving quality of life. Education is required among urologists,\ngeneral practitioners, radiologists, policy makers, and healthy men, including endorsement by the European Commission to adapt the European Council’s screening recommendations in its 2022 plan and requests to individual countries for its incorporation\ninto national cancer plans.\nConclusions: This risk-adapted approach for the early detection of prostate cancer will\nreverse current unfavourable trends and ultimately save lives."

        "Abstract": "For men aged 55 to 69 years, the decision to undergo periodic prostate-specific antigen (PSA)–based screening for prostate cancer should be an individual one. Before deciding whether to be screened, men should have an opportunity to discuss the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician and to incorporate their values and preferences in the decision. Screening offers a small potential benefit of reducing the chance of death from prostate cancer in some men. However, many men will experience potential harms of screening, including false-positive results that require additional testing and possible prostate biopsy; overdiagnosis and overtreatment; and treatment complications, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms on the basis of family history, race/ ethnicity, comorbid medical conditions, patient values about the benefits and harms of screening and treatment-specific outcomes, and other health needs. Clinicians should not screen men who do not express a preference for screening (Table 1). C recommendation. The USPSTF recommends against PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men 70 years and older. D recommendation. See the Clinical Considerations section for more information on screening higher risk populations, including African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer."

The commonly used prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test detects both cancer and non-cancerous conditions. As well, some prostate cancers are slow growing and may not affect a man’s quality of life or cause early death.\nThe Health Select Committee recommended that the Ministry of Health establish a prostate cancer quality improvement programme to raise awareness and understanding of prostate cancer and ensure all men have fair access to quality information and care.\nThe Prostate Cancer Taskforce (the Taskforce), a group of clinical experts, was established in 2012 to agree recommendations for the Prostate Cancer Awareness and Quality Improvement Programme.\nIts recommendations are detailed in this report.\nThe Taskforce recommends providing men and their families and whānau with easily understood information about the prostate, prostate cancer and symptoms.\nIt emphasises the central role of the general practitioner in screening, assessing and supporting men for prostate cancer. Their role may include monitoring men under watchful waiting or active surveillance and the management of metastatic disease and palliative care.\nThe Taskforce also reviewed indications for referral for specialist management. Specialist management includes further clinical assessment, which may lead to men undergoing prostate biopsy and relies on accurate prostate cancer grading by the pathologist.\nTreatment options include active surveillance and curative treatment using surgery or radiation therapy.\nOther considerations that the Taskforce has addressed are palliative care and access to health services."

This article provides a summary of the reports presented during the epidemiology and screening session. Methods to improve early detection and treatment are being developed. Proposed refinements to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing include the use of age-specific PSA levels, PSA velocity, prostate volume-adjusted PSA densities, free-to-total PSA ratios, and complexed PSA. Optimal follow-up screening intervals for persons who elect PSA testing and are found to have initially normal levels have been proposed. Molecular oncology is becoming increasingly important in understanding the development and progression of prostate cancer as well as identifying new therapeutic targets for hormone-refractory disease. Nomograms that include PSA levels, histologic grade, and the extent of the tumor have been developed to optimize management decisions. Despite advances in early detection and treatment, controversy persists because of the lack of evidence demonstrating that they improve length and quality of life. Until results from randomized trials are completed, clinicians should provide patients with balanced information that incorporates the potential risks and benefits of screening and treatment and individual preferences for various outcomes."

Search strategies used\ncombinations of controlled vocabulary (medical subject headings, keywords) and text words.\nGrey literature was identified.\nReview Methods: Three Key Questions (KQs) encompassing broad aspects of the analytic\nvalidity, clinical validity, and clinical utility of SNP-based panels were developed with the input\nof a Technical Expert Panel assembled by the Evidence-based Practice Center and approved by\nthe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Standard systematic review methodology was\napplied, with eligibility criteria developed separately for each KQ.\nResults: From 1,998 unique citations, 14 were retained for data abstraction and quality\nassessment following title and abstract screening and full text screening. All focused on clinical\nvalidity (KQ2), and evaluated 15 individual panels with two to 35 SNPs. All had poor\ndiscriminative ability for predicting risk of prostate cancer and/or distinguishing between\naggressive and asymptomatic/latent disease. The risk of bias of the studies was determined to be\nmoderate. None of the panels had been evaluated in routine clinical settings.\nConclusions: The evidence on currently available SNP panels does not permit meaningful\nassessment of analytic validity. The limited evidence on clinical validity is insufficient to\nconclude that the panels assessed would perform adequately as screening or risk stratification\ntests. No evidence is available on the clinical utility of current panels."

Task Force drafts were reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee and Clinical Affairs Core Committee; representatives of ASBMR, ECTS, ESE, ISCD; and members at large. At each stage, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes. The reviewed document was approved by The Endocrine Society Council before submission for peer review.\nConclusions:\nOsteoporosis in men causes significant morbidity and mortality. We recommend testing higher risk men [aged ≥70 and men aged 50–69 who have risk factors (e.g. low body weight, prior fracture as an adult, smoking, etc.)] using central dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Laboratory testing should be done to detect contributing causes. Adequate calcium and vitamin D and weight-bearing exercise should be encouraged; smoking and excessive alcohol should be avoided. Pharmacological treatment is recommended for men aged 50 or older who have had spine or hip fractures, those with T-scores of −2.5 or below, and men at high risk of fracture based on low bone mineral density and/or clinical risk factors. Treatment should be monitored with serial dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry testing."

        "Abstract": "Objectives. We assessed the evidence about management of uterine fibroids. Specifically, we sought to determine effectiveness of interventions, risks of harm, and whether individual or fibroid characteristics influence outcomes. Data sources. We searched MEDLINE® via PubMed® and Embase® to identify publications, as well as reviewed the reference lists of included studies. Methods. We included studies published in English from January 1985 to September 2016. We identified randomized clinical trials to assess outcomes and harms of interventions. We used data from trials in a meta-analysis to estimate probability and timing of subsequent interventions for fibroids based on initial type of intervention. To describe risk of unrecognized leiomyosarcoma, we included studies that allowed calculation of prevalence of leiomyosarcoma discovered at the time of surgery for masses believed to be fibroids. We also identified publications that indicated operative approaches to removal of leiomyosarcoma tissue and built models to estimate survival. We extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and rated the strength of evidence for informing care. Results. Of 97 included randomized trials, 43 studies assessed medications, 28 assessed procedures, and 37 assessed surgeries. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, mifepristone, and ulipristal reduced fibroid size and improved fibroid-related symptoms, including bleeding and quality of life (moderate strength of evidence [SOE] except quality of life for GnRH agonist [low SOE]). Several other medications have promise but are not supported by sufficient evidence. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) (high SOE) as well as high intensity focused ultrasound (low SOE) are effective for decreasing fibroid size/volume. Few other outcomes are well investigated for high intensity focused ultrasound. UAE studies reported improved outcomes for bleeding (moderate SOE), and quality of life (moderate SOE). Myomectomy and hysterectomy improved q uality of life (both low SOE). Few well-conducted trials directly compared different treatment options. No studies were designed to evaluate expectant management, and evidence is insufficient to guide clinical care. Subsequent intervention ranged from 0 to 44 percent in studies that followed women after initial fibroid treatment. At 2-year followup, subsequent intervention rates were lowest for initial medical management and higher for UAE and myomectomy, especially among younger women. No individual characteristics of women or their fibroids were definitely associated with likelihood of intervention benefits or patient satisfaction. These findings were limited by the number and size of available studies. Using data from 160 studies, we estimated that among 10,000 women having surgery for presumed fibroids, between 0 and 13 will have a leiomyosarcoma detected. Of the surgical approaches, the 5-year survival after leiomyosarcoma diagnosis was 30 percent with power morcellation (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI]: 13% to 61%), 59 percent with scalpel morcellation (BCI: 33% to 84%), and 60 percent with intact removal (BCI: 24% to 98%). Conclusion. A range of interventions are effective for reducing fibroid size and improving symptoms. Some medications and procedures also improve quality of life. Few studies directly compare interventions. The risk of encountering a leiomyosarcoma at the time of fibroid surgery is low, and the method of fibroid removal may influence survival. Evidence to guide choice of ix intervention is likely best when applied in the context of individual patient needs and preferences."
