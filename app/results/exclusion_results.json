    "summary": "Early Detection of Prostate Cancer \nWhat is PSA and how is it connected to prostate \ncancer?\nProstate-specific antigen (PSA) is a protein produced \nwithin the prostate gland. PSA is mostly found in semen, but small amounts can also be found in the blood of healthy men. PSA levels depend on age and naturally go up as you age. There are many reasons why PSA levels fluctuate and higher levels may indicate the presence of prostate cancer or other prostate conditions.\nProstate cancer is typically a slow growing cancer \nthat can be present for many years before causing symptoms. Prostate cancer is highly treatable if diagnosed in the early stages and a PSA test can be valuable in aiding early detection.\nWhat is a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test?\nA prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is a simple blood \ntest that measures the amount of PSA protein in your blood.  Measuring PSA levels can be an useful tool in diagnosing prostate cancer as well as monitoring the progress of the disease in someone who has already been diagnosed with prostate cancer.Who should get tested?\nIf you are a man over the age of 50, it\u2019\ns recommended \nthat you speak with your doctor about your risk of \ndeveloping prostate cancer and whether you should have a PSA test. Your healthcare provider may recommend a PSA test if you: \n\u2022\nare almost 50 years old\n\u2022have a family history of prostate cancer\n\u2022are of African ancestry\n\u2022have symptoms of prostate cancer\n\u2022have already been diagnosed with prostate cancer\nand are being monitored\nWhen is this test ordered?\nA PSA\n test may be ordered by your healthcare provider to:\n\u2022help detect prostate cancer early even if you don\u2019t\nhave any signs or symptoms\n\u2022check for cancer if you are experiencing signs orsymptoms of prostate cancer\n\u2022\nconfirm a diagnosis when other tests suggestprostate cancer\n\u2022\npredict a prognosis (outcome) for prostate cancer\n\u2022predict if cancer has spread outside the prostate\n\u2022plan treatment for prostate cancer\n\u2022monitor you if you are already being treated forprostate cancer\n\u2022\ndetermine if cancer treatments are working\n\u2022determine if cancer has come back after treatment\nProstate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Test\nThe third leading cause of cancer death, when prostate cancer is detected early, it\u2019s more likely to be successfully treated. men in Canada will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime. \n\nHow can I get tested?\nTesting is completed by LifeLabs at a Patient Service \nCentre or via our mobile lab service (available in select cities) through a simple blood sample. You will require a completed test requisition from your healthcare provider.\nUnderstanding your results\nTest results will be provided directly to your healthcare \nprovider for discussion with you. The report will indicate:\n1. Total PSA level in the blood\n2. Free PSA level\n3. Ranges for PSA levels\nPSA levels depend on your age. As you get older, your \nPSA level will naturally go up. If you have a high PSA \nlevel, your doctor will talk to you about your options. A \nhigher than normal PSA level doesn\u2019t always mean you \nhave prostate cancer. High PSA levels can also indicate:\n\u2022 an enlarged prostate due to benign prostatic \nhyperplasia\n\u2022 an inflamed or infected prostate (called prostatitis)\n\u2022 a urinary tract infection\nIt\u2019s important for you to discuss your PSA level results with your doctor. Your doctor will help you determine your risk of prostate cancer in relation to your age, family history and other personal information.How is the test performed?\nBlood sample\nHow much does it cost?\nThe price of this test varies by province. The test \nmay be covered by your private insurance or provincial health plan under some circumstances. Talk to your doctor about your options.\nWhen will I get my results?\nResults are available to your healthcare provider \nwithin 2 weeks.\nSources\n\u2022 Statistics Canada:  \n\u201cProstate cancer trends in Canada, 1995 to 2012\u201d\n\u2022 Prostate Cancer Canada\n\u2022 Canadian Cancer Society\n",
